FIX THIS =


On about and every page, the top image should have the text readable.  the brightness or something needs to be fixed. 



fix the main divs under home page - construct row 
copy the construct code for bottom ones. implemtn the order then



In home page,it takes too long for the wood to show up compared it to the about page, also check it in the mobile view.  I think its bc of z index , the nav is behind the big image.
if you do hte zindex = 1 for the
.navbar.sticky class, it resolves 
line 99 of nav_style


Trail class for about and paul page.  if one works other dont. 


Make the hamburger btn on right white. 


In about us (all) pages, the min height should be min-height: 600px for md view, not for other views.
This can be fixed by creaing a custom class.
